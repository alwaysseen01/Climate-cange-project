                            It has been described as the most important report ever published in the 30-year history of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and an “ear-splitting wake-up call to the world.”
                            The new report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C made headline news around the world with its stark message that limiting warming to 1.5 °C would require unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society. The report stresses the huge benefits to human welfare, ecosystems and sustainable economic development in keeping warming to 1.5 °C compared to 2 °C, or higher.
                            The 33-page Summary for Policymakers and the underlying report was approved by IPCC member governments in Incheon, Republic of Korea, on 6 October. Ninety-one authors and review editors from 40 countries collaborated on the report, which cited more than 6 000 scientific references. It was produced jointly by all three IPCC Working Groups, on the physical science basis of climate change; on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and on mitigation of climate change.

                            Ocean health: Limiting global warming would slow the increases in ocean temperature and acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels and so would reduce risks to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems. But with 1.5 °C, coral reefs are expected to decline by 70–90%, whereas more than 99% would be lost with 2 °C.
                            Biodiversity: Impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, will be lower at 1.5 °C but will still hit thousands of species. Six percent of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates are projected to lose over half of their climatically determined geographic range for global warming of 1.5 °C, compared with 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates for global warming of 2 °C. High-latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of climate change-induced degradation and loss.
                            Extreme events:  Climate models predict increases in mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes (increased number of days with temperature up to 3 °C higher) in most inhabited regions, increased frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions, and increased intensity and frequency of droughts and precipitation deficits in some regions.

                            Global Warming of 1.5 °C is the first in a series of Special Reports to be produced in the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Cycle. Next year the IPCC will release the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, and Climate Change and Land.
                            WMO will continue to provide support to the IPCC throughout the Sixth Assessment Cycle and is intensifying its scientific support for climate change mitigation and adaptation through a new strategy entailing fully integrated, “seamless” Earth-system approach to weather, climate and water domains.
                            Over the last two decades, climate science has made unprecedented progress in better understanding of the functioning of the climate system and in assessing consequences of human interference. Now, more than ever before, we need science to support adaptation to climate extremes and climate change, and to help to guide transformations needed for sustainable development of the planet.
                            Extreme events:  Climate models predict increases in mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes (increased number of days with temperature up to 3 °C higher) in most inhabited regions, increased frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions, and increased intensity and frequency of droughts and precipitation deficits in some regions.
