# Climate-cange-project
This project was a part of my HTML + CSS exam task in IT STEP Academy.

Quick guide to launch it:
  1. Firstly, download all files.
  2. Secondly, unzip "articles-page-images", "help-page-images" folders to the same folder as project. Then, unzip "main-page-images 1", "main-page-images 2" folder
     to one folder named "main-page-images".
  3. Open main-page.html
