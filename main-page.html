                        In 2002, biologist E. O. Wilson calculated that if the current rate of anthropogenic destruction of

                        According to a 2003 survey conducted at 14 biodiversity research centres, 
                        15-37% of terrestrial species are "dead to extinction" by 2050 due to climate change.
                        The ecologically rich regions most threatened by losses are in southern Africa and the Caribbean.

                            The impact of climate change on human society due to warming or changes in precipitation patterns, or both, 
                            has been found worldwide. But the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven. 
                            Risks are expected to rise as global warming increases. All regions are at risk of negative impact.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In 2014, a meta-analysis was conducted, according to which, for every 1 ° C 
                            increase in temperature, the level of violence increases by 20%, including fights, violent crimes, riots or wars.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A 2015 estimate based on the IPCC A1B emissions scenario showed
                            that additional greenhouse gases released from permafrost <span> would cost the global economy $43 trillion. </span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The yield of agricultural crops in middle and high latitudes with an increase in local temperatures 
                            by 1–3 ° C will slightly increase, but further warming will lead to its decrease. In low latitudes (especially in 
                            dry regions and in the tropics), agriculture is highly vulnerable. Even a slight increase in local temperatures 
                            (by 1 - 2 ° C) will increase the danger of starvation. Globally, the potential for agricultural production rises 
                            as local average temperatures rise to 1-3°C, falling as temperatures rise further.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As noted in a 2020 study, if global warming continues at the same pace, up to <span> 3.5 billion people could live 
                                in uninhabitable weather zones in half a century. </span>  The total area of ​​the Earth, where the average annual 
                            temperature exceeds 29 degrees (as in the Sahara desert), will increase from 0.8% to 19% of the land. An 
                            increase in the average annual temperature on Earth for every additional degree can leave about a billion 
                            people without habitable living conditions.

                            WHO claims that climate change affects social and environmental health factors such as clean air, 
                            safe drinking water, adequate food and safe shelter.
                            <br>
                            In general, the impact on public health will be more negative than positive. Extreme weather will cause 
                            injury and death, crop failures threaten malnutrition.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In some regions, there will be a transition from cold to heat mortality. In 2018, the US Centers for Disease 
                            Control and Prevention conducted a study that linked fever and an increase in the number of suicides. 
                            The paper suggests that hot days increase the number of suicides and could cause more than 
                            26,000 suicides in the US by 2050.

                            All the countries represented are the largest economies in the world. Accordingly, they influence the climate
                            the most. CO2 emissions are different for each country. However, <span> the clear leader in this 
                            regard is China. </span>

                            In any case, special organizations have already been created in the world that deal with this issue.
                            Many of the countries represented have signed relevant agreements aimed at reducing carbon dioxide 
                            and sulfur emissions into the atmosphere by 2050.

                            However, many political activists and experts in the field of climatology, ecology and economics express 
                            their doubts about the real course of things in this direction. In the media space, slogans are heard more
